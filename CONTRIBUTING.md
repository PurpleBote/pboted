# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this.

Come find me in [#dev] channel on ilita IRC network in to I2P.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to pboted](https://github.com/polistern/pboted/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).  
Please follow conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits.  
One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```bash
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Coding conventions

After a short discussion, one of the [coding styles](https://github.com/motine/cppstylelineup) will be determined, which better meets our requirements.

But for now:

- We indent using **two spaces**
- We put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`).

Sincerely yours,  
polistern
